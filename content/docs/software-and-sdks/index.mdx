## SDKs

Libraries maintained by Stellar.org:<br />
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk)
API reference: https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/


- [Java](https://github.com/stellar/java-stellar-sdk)

- [Go](https://github.com/stellar/go)

https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/txnbuild

The Go SDK is a set of packages for interacting with most aspects of the Stellar ecosystem. The primary component is the Horizon SDK, which provides convenient access to Horizon services. There are also packages for other Stellar services such as [TOML support](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md) and [federation](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0002.md).

## Horizon SDK

The Horizon SDK is composed of two complementary libraries: `txnbuild` + `horizonclient`.
The `txnbuild` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/txnbuild), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/txnbuild)) package enables the construction, signing and encoding of Stellar [transactions](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/transactions.html) and [operations](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/list-of-operations.html) in Go. 

The `horizonclient` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/clients/horizonclient), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/clients/horizonclient)) package provides a web client for interfacing with [Horizon](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/) server REST endpoints to retrieve ledger information, and to submit transactions built with `txnbuild`.

## List of major SDK packages

- `horizonclient` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/clients/horizonclient), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/clients/horizonclient)) - programmatic client access to Horizon
- `txnbuild` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/txnbuild), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/txnbuild)) - construction, signing and encoding of Stellar transactions and operations
- `stellartoml` ([source](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/clients/stellartoml), [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/clients/stellartoml)) - parse [Stellar.toml](../../guides/concepts/stellar-toml.md) files from the internet
- `federation` ([source](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/clients/federation)) - resolve federation addresses  into stellar account IDs, suitable for use within a transaction

Stellar has 

[Stellar Core]

[Horizon]

[API Reference]


Horizon is the client-facing API server for the Stellar ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [Stellar Core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core) and applications that want to access the Stellar network. Horizon allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, and subscribe to event streams. For more details, see an [overview of the Stellar network](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/).

You can interact directly with Horizon via cURL or a web browser. Stellar.org also provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://www.stellar.org/developers/js-stellar-sdk/reference/) for clients to use to interact with Horizon.

Stellar.org runs an [instance of Horizon](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/) that is connected to the [testnet](../guides/concepts/test-net.md).
